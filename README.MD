# File-Upload Repository

This repository contains a simple example of how to implement file uploads using Node.js, Express, and Cloudinary. It includes both backend and frontend components to demonstrate the process of uploading images and storing them in the cloud using the Cloudinary service. Additionally, you can use Postman to interact with the backend API and upload images.

## Features

- Backend built with Node.js and Express.
- Utilizes the `express-fileupload` middleware for handling file uploads.
- Images are stored on the cloud using Cloudinary's services.
- Minimalistic frontend app to showcase the file upload process in a real project.
- Postman can be used to directly upload images via the provided API endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed.
- Cloudinary account (API key, API secret, and cloud name).
- Postman (for testing API endpoints).
